As a data scientist I can turn seemingly meaningless data into a recommendation to help a company improve its product, services, or experiences. This can help a business grow or get more clients.\n\n2) I am a technophile. I love using the latest and greatest technology. Whether that is hardware or software, I enjoy getting my hands on with these new technologies to see how that can enrich our lives.\n\n3) Possibly the number one reason I got into data science, I have a passion for helping. In data science that could be helping a business understand its customers or improving the way it uses its customer data. I get a fantastic feeling of job satisfaction when I see the fruits of my labor helping in many different ways. </i>\n",
